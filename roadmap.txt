
__Longterm__ 

Scanner: 
- Add line/column numbers for each token
    - Probably just counting number of newline characters.
- Create own scanner, don't use regex library. 
    - Bunch of switch and if? Probably.
    - Means I don't have to run in WSL, more work though and likely less extensible.
